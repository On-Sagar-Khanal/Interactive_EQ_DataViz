# Dynamic and Interactive Earthquake Occurence Visualization in Nepal
This project was developed as part of the DAT/Artathon 2024 (https://datartathon.com). 

1. The data for the project is obtained from Nepal Earthquake Monitoring Center (https://seismonepal.gov.np/earthquakes). You may use the scraper in python to scrape data at any time in the future (although minor modifications maybe required if the website has changed)

2. After updating the data, run the .html file through a code compiler to obtain the visualization. If you're using VS code open it through a live server.
